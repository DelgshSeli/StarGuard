# StarGuard
A Chrome extension that provides live filtering for specified words and emails in online content with a stars overlay. This extension replaces matched words and emails with stars, creating a visual representation of censoring. It seamlessly applies the overlay in real-time as the user types, even in dynamically added content and text fields.
